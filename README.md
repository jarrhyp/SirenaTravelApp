# Sirena Travel App
Hello! Here is the official Travel App for Sirena. Hope you enjoy using the app.

Please note this is a prototype for my design assignment, not an actual app.
It's available for Windows.

If you're here to mark the assignment, please use the 'Releases' section, as it'll contain an actual binary.

## Instructions

Go to releases, then download the Windows zip file. Unzip it and then launch the executable.
